Klaviyo App Setup Instructions
===

To install the Klaviyo App you must first create a __Private API Key__. Head over to your Klaviyo account to get started.

Once you've logged in, click on your avatar at the bottom left of the screen and choose "Settings"

Give the API key a name - this can be anything, something like "Deskpro App" will do.

For the __Access Level__, select __"Custom Key"__ and choose the following scopes:
* Account: __read__;
* List: __read__;
* Profiles: __full access__;
* Segments: __read__.

Click __"Create"__ and copy __Your Private Key__. And __keep this API key private, safe and secure__.

When you install the Klaviyo App in Deskpro, enter this key into the settings tab of the app.

To configure who can see and use the Klaviyo app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
